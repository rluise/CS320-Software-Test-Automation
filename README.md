How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I check on the test. It has to mirror the requirements because, after all, it is the same software that needs to be tested and make sure that is functioning as required. Using Gradle plus JaCoCo helps show which code has been exercised and see that everything is being
covered with validtions and error paths. Thinking on a group / team setting, it is important to only give the permission needed to certain users to keep data secure. Additionally, it is important to minimize log, specially if it has PII. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Listening is very important to capture the information that the user needs. You have to understand their problems so that there are more roads to tackle and prevent a problem and not just focus too much on the features of a program. I think that being able to show a small
prototype of the project helps with clients/users with something somewhat palpable intead of just saying the idea. It is always important to ask for feedback after a project is deployed to the customer. Always follow through with metrics on how the program is being used and
work closely with them to make sure it is working as intended.

How do I approach designing software?
Like I mentioned above, keeping logs and metrics is important to see how the product is evolving/developing. By testing the system we can validate inputs, sanitize outputs, which improves its security. Listening to the customer/user since day one and testing from day one
assures that the system will funcion. This assurance comes from also making those test simple which test pure functions and dependencies so its fast and isolated.
